# Fit Healthy

## DESCRIPTION
This application is designed to support patients in adopting and tracking therapeutic physical activities tailored to their medical profiles. By leveraging user-specific data (e.g., age, gender, pathology), the system recommends suitable activities, allows users to build personalized therapy plans, and collects feedback to improve future recommendations.
Inspired by real-world health & sport initiatives from the Centre-Val de Loire region (France), this project integrates structured activity data (provided via JSON export) into a relational database and delivers intelligent, profile-based suggestions.
